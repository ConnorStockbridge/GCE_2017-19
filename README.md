# GCE Computer Science (2017-19): Class Repo

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the GCE Computer Science class of 2017-19!

### The purpose of this repo is as follows:
1. To provide **outlines and exemplars** to the code challenges set on Go4Schools / shs.cloud;
1. To facilitate the **two-way exchange of submission feedback** between teacher and student; and
1. To encourage **communication and collaboration** between all members of the class.

## Getting Started

**_If you don't yet have a GitHub account, register for one now using your school email address!_**

1. **Fork** this repo to your GitHub account.
1. **Clone** the fork to your Computer Science folder to create a local repo.
1. **Configure** your git credentials in your local repo via bash.
1. **Create a new folder** in your local repo called **3. Solutions** and sync with GitHub.
  
_For **detailed instructions**, please refer to the **Setup Guide**._

## Submission Procedure

Throughout the course you will regularly be given **code challenges** to complete. You should be set a challenge **every 1 to 2 weeks** (depending on the difficulty of the task and/or other course requirements). Initially, you will be provided with a **code outline** for each challenge but as the course progresses you will be expected to **develop your solutions from scratch**, following the style and structure of the outlines. Targeted **feedback** will be provided following each submission via GitHub. You will be expected to **reflect** upon and **respond** to each piece of feedback **within 24 hours**.

### The procedure for completing challenges will typically be as follows:
1. Your challenge is set at the end of the week; instructions and deadlines will appear on Go4Schools / shs.cloud.
1. The class repo will be updated (initially) with an outline for that challenge.
1. You create a **PULL request** on GitHub to update your fork with a copy of the outline.
1. You **SYNC** your local repo (at school and/or at home) with GitHub to develop your solution offline.
1. You **COPY** the outline in your local repo to your "3. Solutions" folder and develop your solution from there.
1. Once your solution is complete, you **COMMIT** it to your fork on GitHub.
1. Upon receiving feedback, you reflect and respond within 24 hours.

**_NB: Your code must be submitted BEFORE the start of the lesson in which it is due!_**

_The process may seem rather complicated at first but it will get easier as you go!_

_Just remember:_
**_PULL -> SYNC -> COPY -> COMMIT_**

## Getting Help

There are a number of resources at your disposal should you find yourself needing some help with the challenges. 

### For example, you could:
* Check out the **class wiki** for guidance
* Read the **documentation** on [Python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/) or [TutorialsPoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm)
* Create and submit a **new issue** on the class repo
* Search for advice on **forums** such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

**Note: Students are strongly encouraged to contribute both to the class wiki as well as to any open issues on the class repo!**

## Finally...

### Make sure that you:
  1. **Watch this repo** for notification of all conversations;
  1. **Regularly sync** your local repo with GitHub **and commit** any changes you make;
  1. **Regularly create pull requests** to receive any new content from the class repo; and
  1. **Always aim to achieve your best** no matter how hard it gets or how many times you might fail!

**_We welcome you again and hope that you enjoy the course!_**
